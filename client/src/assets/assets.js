        "description": "<h1>Matcha Tiramisu</h1><p>Creamy, rich, and bursting with flavor, this irresistible Matcha Tiramisu layers green tea-soaked ladyfingers with a light and airy mascarpone cream. It’s a modern Japanese twist on the classic Italian dessert. The vibrant green pop of color will wow your guests at your next party.</p><h2>Ingredients:</h2><p>3 large egg yolks (one egg yolk is about 19 g; at room temperature)</p><p>70 g sugar (divided)</p><p>2 Tbsp marsala wine (highly recommend; missing a kick without it; can substitute with dark rum or brandy)</p><p>227 g mascarpone cheese (at room temperature)</p><p>360 ml heavy (whipping) cream (chilled)</p><br><h3>For the Cookie Layer</h3><p>120 ml water (heated to 175ºF/80ºC)</p><p>9 g matcha (green tea powder)</p><p>24 ladyfingers (divided, for 2 layers; you will need 36 cookies for 3 layers)</p><br><h3>For Serving</h3><p>12 g matcha (green tea powder) (for dusting)</p><h2>Instructions:</h2><h3><u>Before You Start…</u></h3><ol><li>Please note that this is a chilled dessert and requires at least 4 hours of chilling time, preferably overnight.</li><li>Gather all the ingredients and equipment.</li><li>You will need a medium saucepan, a medium heatproof mixing bowl to set over the saucepan, and two large bowls. Fill one of the large bowls with water and ice and make sure that the mixing bowl fits in this ice bath; set aside for cooling the egg mixture later. Also, set an instant-read thermometer near the double boiler in the next step.</li><li>Set up a double boiler. First, add 2 inches of water to the saucepan. Next, set the mixing bowl on top and check that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Set aside the mixing bowl to use for the egg mixture. Bring the water to a bare simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low.</li></ol><h3><u>To Cook the Egg Mixture</u></h3><ol><li>In the medium heatproof mixing bowl, add 3 large egg yolks, 2 Tbsp marsala wine, and 3 Tbsp of the 70 g sugar. Start whisking it with a handheld electric mixer.</li><li>Set the bowl over the saucepan of barely simmering water and continue to beat the egg yolks. Over the next 10 minutes or so, you‘ll gently cook this egg mixture until it registers 160ºF (71ºC), when it‘s safe to consume. Keep your instant-read thermometer handy to check the temperature. </li><p>Tip: At around 160ºF, your eggs may turn into scrambled eggs; therefore, I highly recommend both an electric mixer and an instant-read thermometer for this process (please read my post).</p><li>Continue to cook the egg mixture, beating it constantly. The egg mixture will increase in volume and becoming lighter in texture. It also will turn a pale yellow color.</li><li>Continue whisking. I use Speed 3 of a 5-speed hand mixer throughout this process. Continue to check the temperature.</li><li>As soon as the egg mixture reaches 160ºF (71ºC), immediately remove the mixing bowl from the saucepan. Set the bowl in the ice bath to quickly stop the cooking. Let it cool for 1 minute.</li></ol><h3><u>To Make the Mascarpone Cream</u></h3><ol><li>Meanwhile, put 227 g mascarpone cheese in another large bowl and soften it with a silicone spatula. Add the cooled egg mixture into the bowl with the mascarpone.</li><li>Note: The egg mixture does get cooked a bit on the sides of the bowl from the double boiler. Do not scrape off or use this cooked egg in your mascarpone mixture.</li><li>Gently fold the egg mixture into the mascarpone until just smooth. Tip: The egg mixture will become grainy if overmixed.</li><li>Now, make the whipped cream: In another bowl, beat 360 ml heavy (whipping) cream until foamy; you can reuse the bowl from the ice bath, but make sure it‘s completely dry. Then, gradually add the rest of the sugar.</li><li>Beat together until medium peaks form. The cream holds its shape well but is still soft and hasn’t started to become grainy. When you lift out the whisk, peaks will form but they will bend over at the end.</li><li>Now, gently fold the whipped cream mixture into the mascarpone mixture.</li><li>Fold the mascarpone cream until well combined.</li></ol><h3><u>To Assemble</u></h3><ol><li>In a small bowl, combine 120 ml water (heated to 175ºF/80ºC) and 9 g matcha (green tea powder). Whisk together until there are no lumps. Transfer this matcha mixture to a flat-bottomed container big enough for a ladyfinger cookie to lay flat.</li><li>Gather 24 ladyfingers. One at a time, quickly dip a ladyfinger into the matcha mixture until soaked but not soggy; use a pair of tongs to flip it over to soak the other side. Then, place it on the bottom of an 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20 cm) baking dish. Repeat until you‘ve arranged 2 rows of 6 ladyfingers each.</li><li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers in an even layer. Smooth out the surface using the silicone spatula or a silicone pastry scraper.</li><li>Create a second layer of cookies, dipping the remaining ladyfingers in the matcha mixture and placing them in 2 neat rows on top of the mascarpone cream layer.</li><li>Top with the remaining cream and smooth out the top. Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap placed directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li></ol><h3><u>To Serve</u></h3><ol><li>Remove your chilled Matcha Tiramisu from the refrigerator and unwrap the plastic. Immediately before serving, dust 12 g matcha (green tea powder) on top of the tiramisu using a fine-mesh sieve. Enjoy!</li></ol><h3><u>To Store</u></h3><ol><li>You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li></ol>",

        "title": "Amaretto Sour",
        "description": "<h1>Amaretto Sour</h1><p>The Amaretto Sour is thought to have first originated in the 1970s as a promotional push from liqueur brand Disaronno, then known as Amaretto di Saronno. It's a take on the classic sour template of drinks—those that include a spirit combined with sweet and sour elements—that's unique for a few reasons.</p><p>Amaretto is an Italian liqueur that’s typically flavored with almonds or apricot stones. Its distinctive profile can be incorporated into numerous cocktails, but notes of deep cherry and toasted nuts lend themselves particularly well to cocktails (like the Sour) which benefit from both depth and sweetness.</p><h2>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>1 1/2 ounces amaretto liqueur</li><li>3/4 ounce cask-proof bourbon</li><li>1 ounce lemon juice, freshly squeezed</li><li>1 teaspoon rich simple syrup</li><li>1/2 ounce egg white</li><li>Garnish: lemon twist</li><li>Garnish: 2 brandied cherries</li></ul><h2>Steps</h2><ol><li>Add amaretto, bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white to a shaker and dry-shake (no ice) for 15 seconds.</li><li>Add ice and shake again until well-chilled.</li><li>Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.</li><li>Garnish with a lemon twist and 2 skewered brandied cherries.</li></ol><h2>Why Cask-Strength Bourbon?</h2><p>Regular bourbon is diluted to around 40% ABV, while cask-strength bourbon is bottled at the same ABV it reaches after aging—this can hover around 50–75% ABV. With a full 1 1/2 ounces of amaretto and an additional teaspoon of rich simple syrup, the sweetness and acid levels are high in Morganthaler’s Amaretto Sour. As such, the sharp edge of a cask-strength is needed to balance the other elements.</p><h2>Do I Really Need to Dry Shake an Amaretto Sour?</h2><p>The short answer: Yes. The goal of the first shake of a sour of this type is to froth the egg white and incorporate it with the other ingredients. If you do not shake sufficiently at this stage, the egg white won’t achieve its goal becoming less of a meringue that tops your drink, and more of a slug of raw egg..</p>",

This version enjoyed a decade-long run, but it didn’t last.</p><p>The 1929 recipe, which is still today’s preferred recipe, calls for gin, orange liqueur, lemon juice and egg white. “It’s a dramatic change,” says Brendan Bartley, the beverage director of The 18th Room in New York.
